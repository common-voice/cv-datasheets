## Language
Mina (also called Gen, Gɛn gbe, Popo) is a Gbe language spoken primarily in southern Togo (Maritime Region) and in southern Benin (Mono Department). It is part of the Kwa branch of the Niger-Congo family. The language is used in daily communication, religious contexts, oral literature, and traditional expressions.
<!-- ### Variants -->
<!-- Original Answer: -->
<!-- This dataset focuses on the standardized Mina / Gen variety as documented in the *Alphabet des langues nationales* (Benin) and grammars of Gen. Regional lexical and phonetic variation is present (e.g. influence from neighboring Gbe languages), but the dataset aims for consistent orthography. -->
