The collected texts were first gathered from books, manuscripts, and community contributions. Additional sentences were created to cover gaps in vocabulary and grammar. All materials were transcribed into a consistent format using the Arabic (Perso-Arabic) script adapted for Dameli. The data was then carefully reviewed and proofread to remove errors and ensure accuracy. Finally, the sentences were digitized, standardized, and compiled into a single corpus of 5,670 sentences for use in research and language development.
