Breton (Brezhoneg) is the only Celtic language spoken on the continent. It belongs to the Brittonic branch of the Celtic languages, like Welsh and Cornish. Breton is classified as "severely endangered" by the UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger. The language declined from more than one million speakers around 1950 to less than 200 000 in 2024. After a period of intense protest that began in the 1960s, Breton gradually regained a place in schools, on road signs, then in the media, public life in general, and more recently in digital technology. With the creation of the first bilingual schools at the end of the 1970s, young people were once again speaking Breton, and a change in the way people viewed the language and its use began. Approximately 20 000 pupils attend Breton bilingual classes, either in the Diwan network (immersive teaching) or in bilingual classes in public and catholic school systems. In addition to evening breton classes for adults (~4 000), long-term courses (6 to 9 months) are offered to adults, with approximately 350 places available annually and online courses too (more than 15 000 learners).
