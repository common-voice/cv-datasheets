Western Sierra Puebla Nahuatl, alternatively Zacatlán-Ahuacatlán-Tepetzintla Nahuatl, is a 
variety of Nahuatl spoken in the Northwestern region of Puebla's Sierra Norte. A 2009 report
from Mexico's National Institute of Indigenous Languages estimates approximately 17,000 speakers.

The language code is `nhi`. There is quite a bit of variation within the nhi variant, varying between
municipalities and communities. For example, some towns, near San Miguel Tenango, use "inverted prefixes" compared
to the rest of the Nahuatl-speaking area, (e.g. *in-nihnimi* instead of *ni-nihnimi*, "I walk").
The sentences in this corpus come from the `nhi` Universal Dependencies treebank, which is made up of samples 
from all three municipalities, and a set of dictionary-style example sentences written by a speaker from the 
Tepetzintla municipality.
