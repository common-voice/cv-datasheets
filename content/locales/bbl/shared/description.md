This language belongs to the Nakhi language family and is currently endangered. The language is acknowledged by researchers as much older than the two other languages of this language family - Chechen and Ingush. The grammar of this language was the first to be scientifically studied among all Iberian-Caucasian languages (A. Schiefner, Versuch über die Tush-Sprache, Petersburg, 1854). This ancient language, brought to this day by the ethnically Georgian (Orthodox Christian) aboriginal bilingual population, was spoken by more than 3,000 people a century ago.
This language was known, and still is known, in the main settlement of the Tush people - the village of Zemo Alvani - by people from other parts of Georgia and other nationalities who settled there during World War I-II.
In recent decades, as a result of the outflow of the working-age population from the country, the connection between generations has been severed, and mixed marriages have become more common. That's why today only the older generation knows the language well, the 40+ generation not so well, and those under 25 mostly only understand it and cannot speak. That is, fewer than 800 people scattered around the world speak this language to a greater or lesser extent, and about 400 locally.
In fact, the scientific study of the language today is in complete stagnation - the language is unexplored. Although there is a lot to be studied, both in terms of this language itself and its connection with the Georgian-Kartvelian and Hurrian languages. This language course is no longer taught in the country's higher education institutions.
The language is referred to by different terms - the Georgian term Tushuri and the Russian term тушинский; during the USSR, it was replaced by the term Batsburi - бацбийский, and after that by Tsova Tush. People are dissatisfied - by changing the name of their language, the Tushetians - this border-defending people, praised many times in history - appear as an unclear ethnicity.
But the language is still alive - enthusiasts even translate poetry into this language, while maintaining rhyme, meter, and rhythm.
