# *Basaa* &mdash; Basaa (`bas`)
This datasheet is for version 1.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Spontaneous Speech* dataset 
for Basaa (`bas`). The dataset contains 773 clips representing 6 hours of recorded
speech (6 hours validated) from 11 speakers.

## Language
Basaa is a narrow Bantu language spoken across a geographical area spanning three administrative regions in Cameroon: the Centre, Littoral and South regions. It is estimated that there are currently around 600,000–700,000 speakers. This figure includes different varieties, as well as diasporic populations who identify as Basaa speakers.

The vitality of the Basaa language is stable (Ethnologue online). However, intergenerational transmission of Basaa is increasingly threatened among parents aged 50 and under, particularly in urban areas.

Although Basaa is taught in schools, this does not significantly impact the vitality of the language, mainly due to the current pedagogical approach, which relies on rule-based and descriptivist teaching methods.

The glossonym 'Basaa' is a generic term that encompasses a range of varieties, the speakers of which may identify with the 'Basaa' label to varying degrees, depending on a complex set of geographical, social, political, situational and pragmatic factors. Whether a language variant is considered Basaa depends greatly on the perspective of the person 'telling the story'. Some of the most commonly acknowledged varieties of Basaa include:
- Mbene
- Bikok
- Babimbi
- Basaa ba Omeng
- Basaa ba Yabasi 
Basaa ba Duala
- Ndog-Bikim

Other varieties, such as Ndonga, Mbaa (also known as Mbay-Bati) and Hijuk, may also be classified as Basaa. However, as previously mentioned, not everyone agrees on this classification.

### Writing system
The prompts and responses in this dataset are written in the Latin alphabet, following the orthography of Protestant missionaries but with modifications introduced by the dataset's author. One such modification is the use of an apostrophe before the symbols 'y' and 'b' to signal nasal prefixes. For example:
'me n'yo': 'stealing palm wine from the palm trunk' (as opposed to *me nyo*, meaning 'drinking'), and *m'bôñ*, meaning 'poison'. 'cassava' (vs. 'mbôñ': 'poison'). As a general rule, the apostrophe signals 'accidentals' of a morphological or prosodic nature.
