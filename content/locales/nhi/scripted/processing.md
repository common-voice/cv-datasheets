The original sentences from the UD treebank are written in varying orthographic norms. Prior to their inclusion into the Common Voice corpus,
the orthgoraphy was converted to the SIL San Miguel Tenango orthography ("ilv") using a rule-based automatic converter from the [py-elotl Python package](https://aclanthology.org/2025.americasnlp-1.5/), followed by some manual verification.
