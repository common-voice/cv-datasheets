# *[Bakoko]* &mdash; Bakoko (`bkh`)

This datasheet is for version 23.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Scripted Speech* dataset 
for Bakoko (`bkh`). The dataset contains 15 hours of recorded
speech (11 hours validated) from 13 speakers.

## Language

<!-- {{LANGUAGE_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- Provide a brief (1-2 paragraph) description of your language -->
Bakoko is a Narrow Bantu language spoken in the Sanaga-Maritime Division, Littoral Region in Cameroon.

### Variants 

<!-- {{VARIANT_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- @ OPTIONAL @ -->
<!-- Describe the variants (MCV variants) of your language -->
Contributors to this dataset have reported various varieties that coexist and whose speakers identify more or less as Bakoko: Adie, Yakalak, Yasag, and Bisoo. This classification is likely not consensual, as different varieties may claim distinct ethnolinguistic identities.

The sentence prompts used to compile this dataset mostly represent the Yakalak variety.
