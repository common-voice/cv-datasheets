The text corpus for the Kabardian language in the Common Voice project consists of a diverse collection of sentences contributed by native speakers. These sentences cover a wide range of topics, including everyday conversations, cultural references, and various domains such as literature, news articles, conversational texts, technology, health, and education. The maximum length of Kabardian sentences in this dataset is limited to 15 words and 140 characters due to restrictions in the Common Voice interface. However, Kabardian sentences can naturally be much longer. In this dataset, the average length has been aimed to be maintained at around 6–8 words and 80–100 characters to reflect the typical structure and complexity of the Kabardian language. The corpus has been curated to ensure a broad representation of vocabulary and grammatical constructs, making it suitable for training robust speech recognition models.
