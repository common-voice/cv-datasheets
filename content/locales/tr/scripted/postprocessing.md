- Because there has been no sentence validation, there are some non-alphabet characters in the text corpus, especially coming from the [SETimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_European_Times) corpus via proper names.
  You may like to remove these.
- Don't normalize extra characters used for Arabic/Farsi loanwords (â, î, û), normalizing them to a/ı/u will change the meaning and intonation.
- There are some proper names containing x and w, there are few and can be removed. We usually keep them because they are also used in minority languages of Turkey and in some proper names.
