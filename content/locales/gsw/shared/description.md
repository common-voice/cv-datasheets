Elsassisch (Alsatian in English, Alsacien in French) is a language spoken in the Alsace region in the East of France. As of 2022, 46 % of the population of the region declares speaking Alsatian. The term Alsatian refers to a linguistic continuum that includes varieties of Alemannic and Franconian. It shares the Alemannic language family with Swiss German and the Franconian language family with Luxembourgish.

 Note on the language code : There is currently no language code for specifically Alsatian. GSW is the code of Swiss German. However, the Common Voice community for Swiss German has chosen to be included under the umbrella of German, and thus isn't using the language code. It has been agreed to use GSW for Alsatian in the context of Common Voice. This does not mean that Alsatian is the same as Swiss German (even if some features are shared), and care should be taken to not mix up the two languages.
