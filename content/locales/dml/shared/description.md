Dameli is one of the most vulnerable languages of Pakistan. The language is spoken in a few remote villages, Asper, Dondidari, Ponagram and Shintari and the surrounding hamlets in the side valley called Damel in northern mountainous area of district Chitral of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. This vulnerability becomes more critical because of the community’s fewer numbers of speakers (about 6500 in total) In UNESCO’S  Atlas of the world languages in Danger, Dameli is listed as “Severely endangered” (Elnazarov, 2010).The entry on Dameli was contributed by Hakim Elnazarov, and was based on information in Decker (1992).
