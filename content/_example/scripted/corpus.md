The initial text corpus (v17.0-v21.0) was built from teaching materials provided by the Klingon Language Institute under public domain dedication.

Starting with v22.0, community-submitted sentences through the Common Voice Sentence Collector became the primary growth source. These cover everyday conversational topics, cultural references, and some technical vocabulary.

In v24.0, transcriptions from three Klingon Opera performances were added, expanding the formal register coverage.
