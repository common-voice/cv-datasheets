Actual values of text corpus from the [previous version](https://analyzer.cv-toolbox.web.tr/examine/tr/22.0) (please check the text corpus tab) show that:

- Average `Characters/Sentence` of the whole corpus is `62.25`, but validated set average is `35.915`. Median values are `61` and `27` respectively.
- Average `Words/Sentence` of the whole corpus is `8.379`, but validated set average is `5.096`. Median values are `8` and `4` respectively.
- Shorter sentences in the older text corpus resulted in shorter recording durations, which is `3.8` seconds on the average (in the previous dataset).
  This value is increasing with each version, and we aim to reach `5 sec`, which is the ideal minimum of most SotA model architectures.
