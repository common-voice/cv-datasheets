Bankon, also known as Abo, is a Bantu language spoken in the Moungou Division of Cameroon's Littoral Region. Bakon is closely related to Barombi, also known as Lombi, Balombi, or Barumbi, which is spoken in the Meme Division of the Southwest Region of Cameroon. Therefore, a striking trait that distinguishes the two speech groups is not their intrinsic typological distance, but the colonial demarcation between the French-speaking and English-speaking parts of Cameroon. This is a direct consequence of the joint trusteeship that France and Great Britain held over Cameroon.
