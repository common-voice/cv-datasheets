The average length of validated sentences is 5.5 words (34 characters). The corpus contains numerous Spanish loanwords, calques, and code-switching. For example, the following sentence from the corpus contains the Spanish conjunction *pero* "but", Spanish preposition *de* "of", the subordinator *hasta* "until", a morphologically-adapted loanword *oniquestudiaro* (from *estudiar* "to study"), and a morphologically-adapted number, *ocho* "eight" (*tiochoque* "we are eight"). Due to long-standing language contact and bilingualism, Nahuatl commonly incorporates elements of Spanish, and this is well-represented in the text corpus.

> *Pero de nochten tlen tiochoque sa ye neh oniquestudiaro hasta cuando onipiyaya dieciocho años.*
> 
> "But of all of us eight I was the only one who studied until when I was eighteen years old."
