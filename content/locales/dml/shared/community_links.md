As internet access is limited in the Dameli Valley, most local communication takes place through community gatherings, cultural events, and village meeting. However, Dameli people living in cities and outside the valley stay connected online. They maintain a WhatsApp group called “Anjuman Taraqi Damyan Basha”, where members share poetry, cultural materials, news, and language-related resources. In this way, both offline and online platforms help keep the community connected and engaged in language preservation.
