# *[Ushojo]* &mdash; Ushojo (`ush`)
This datasheet is for version 1.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Spontaneous Speech* dataset 
for Ushojo (`ush`). The dataset contains 6 hours of recorded
speech (5 hours validated) from 10 speakers.

## Language
Ushojo is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by about 1000-1200 people in Bishigram near Madyan in Swat Pakistan.
<!-- {{LANGUAGE_DESCRIPTION}} -->

Basaa is a Narrow Bantu language spoken across a geographical area spanning three administrative regions in Cameroon: the Centre, Littoral and South regions. It can be estimated that there are currently around 600,000–700,000 speakers. This figure includes different varieties, as well as diasporic populations who identify as Basaa speakers.

The vitality of the Basaa language is stable ([https://www.ethnologue.com/language/bas/](Ethnologue online)). However, intergenerational transmission of Basaa is increasingly threatened among parents aged 50 and under, particularly in urban areas.

Although Basaa is taught in schools, this does not significantly impact the vitality of the language, mainly due to the current pedagogical approach, which relies on rule-based and descriptivist teaching methods.

TThe glossonym 'Basaa' is a generic term that encompasses a range of varieties, the speakers of which may identify with the 'Basaa' label to varying degrees, depending on a complex set of geographical, social, political, situational and pragmatic factors. Whether a language variant is considered Basaa depends greatly on the perspective of the person 'telling the story'. Some of the most commonly acknowledged varieties of Basaa include:
- Mbene
- Bikok
- Babimbi
- Basaa ba Omeng
- Basaa ba Yabasi 
Basaa ba Duala
- Ndog-Bikim

Other varieties, such as Ndonga, Mbaa (also known as Mbay-Bati) and Hijuk, may also be classified as Basaa. However, as previously mentioned, not everyone agrees on this classification.

<!-- A description of the writing system (or writing systems) used in the text corpus -->
The prompts and responses in this dataset are written in the Latin alphabet, following the orthography of Protestant missionaries, with some modifications introduced by the dataset's author. These modifications include signalling nasal prefixes with an apostrophe before the symbols 'y' and 'b'. For example:
*me n'yo*: 'steal palm wine from the palm trunk' (vs. *me nyo*: 'drink'); *m'bôñ*: 'cassava' (vs. *mbôñ*: 'poison'). As a general rule, the apostrophe signals 'accidentals' of a morphological or prosodic nature.
