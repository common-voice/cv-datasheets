Catalan is a Romance language spoken by about 9 milion people mainly on the Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula. 

It is an official language, along with Spanish or Castilian, in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community (where it
is also called Valencian), while it is the only official language of the Principality of Andorra. It is also spoken, and has some administrative recognition, without reaching official status,
in the eastern part of the autonomous community of Aragon, in the French department Pyrénées-Orientales (Eastern
Pyrenees) and in the city of Alghero, on the island of Sardinia (Italy).

The language evolved from Vulgar Latin in the Middle Ages.
