Ewondo is a Narrow Bantu language which is indigenous to a population mainly located in the Centre Region of Cameroon, with pockets of settlements in the South, and East Regions. Having been one among the earlier developped languages within the so-called Beti-Fang group - with comparable earlier development to be found in the Bulu language of the same Beti-Fang group, Ewondo is vehicular to populations in the South and East Regions of Cameroon, and has also developed into a creole known as *Mongo Ewondo*;
