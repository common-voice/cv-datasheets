### Fields
Each row of a `tsv` file represents a single audio clip, and contains the following information:

* `client_id` - hashed UUID of a given user
* `audio_id` - numeric id for audio file
* `audio_file` - audio file name
* `duration_ms` - duration of audio in milliseconds
* `prompt_id` - numeric id for prompt
* `prompt` - question for user
* `transcription` - transcription of the audio response
* `votes` - number of people that who approved a given transcript
* `age` - age of the speaker[^1]
* `gender` - gender of the speaker[^1]
* `language` - language name
* `split` - for data modelling, which subset of the data does this clip pertain to
* `char_per_sec` - how many characters of transcription per second of audio
* `quality_tags` - some automated assessment of the transcription--audio pair, separated by |
   * `transcription-length` - character per second under 3 characters per second
   * `speech-rate` - characters per second over 30 characters per second
   * `short-audio` - audio length under 2 seconds
   * `long-audio` - audio length over 30 seconds
   * `non-allowed-script` - Tag for transcriptions containing a writing system non associated with the language.
   * `mixed-script-words` - ag for transcriptions containing multiple writing systems at the word/token level.
   * `mixed-script-transcription` - Tag for transcriptions containing multiple writing systems, but each word/token consistently uses a single script
   * `dataset-language-audio-mismatch` - Tag for audio where the spoken language could not be verified that it is in the expected dataset language with high confidence by an ASR model.
