## Text corpus

### Writing system
In 2023, the [Academia Aragonesa de la Lengua](https://academiaaragonesadelalengua.org), a public institution created as language regulatory body, established the [Orthography of Aragonese](https://https://academiaaragonesadelalengua.org/sites/default/files/ficheros-pdf/ortografia-aragones.pdf) as the official spelling for the language. The spelling system is flexible enough to allow writing all Aragonese varieties.

All the submitted sentences have been adapted to the official orthography, although errors can be found occasionally.

### Sources
Sentences have been obtained from the works of two writters whose works are already in the public domain: Dámaso Carrera and Domingo Miral, as well as by living authors who have submitted sentences from their own works.
