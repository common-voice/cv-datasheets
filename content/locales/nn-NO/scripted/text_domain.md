The corpus was initially seeded with sentences from
* Book reviews and book discussions (from the web community bokelskere.no)
* Transcribed and manually checked discussions from the Norwegian Parliament (Stortinget), from 2017 to 2018

Later, several individual users have contributed sentences in various
domains through Mozilla's web interface.
