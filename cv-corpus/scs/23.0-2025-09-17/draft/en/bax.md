# *Shüpamom* &mdash; Bamun (`bax`)

This datasheet is for version 23.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Scripted Speech* dataset 
for Bamun (`bax`). The dataset contains 13 hours of recorded
speech (11 hours validated) from 13 speakers.

## Language

<!-- {{LANGUAGE_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- Provide a brief (1-2 paragraph) description of your language -->
Bamun or Shupamem is a Bantu-Grassfield language spoken in the Noun Divison, West Region in Cameroon.  

### Variants 
The Bamun language is quite homogeneous within their indigenous territory, the Noun Administrative Division. However, the Administrative Atlas of Cameroon's Languages (Breton and Bikia Fohtung, 1991) indicates a few "islands" outside the Noun Department where the Bamun language exhibits minor variations. These include Bapi in the Mifi Division in the West Region and Bamalang and Bangolan in the Mezam Division in the Northwest Region.

The variant represented in the collection of sentence prompts is that spoken in the Noun Division.
