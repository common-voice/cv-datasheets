The [Matsés](https://bdpi.cultura.gob.pe/lenguas/matses) language, ISO code [mcf](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/mcf/) belongs to the Pano family and is spoken in the basins of the Gálvez and Yaquirana rivers, and in the Añushiyacu creek, in the Loreto department of Peru. It has also traditionally been known as "mayuruna", although today the speakers themselves prefer to call it Matsés.
