The Asheninka are a South America first nation and their language belong to the Arawak linguistic family, they are primarily located in the central Peruvian rainforest between the eastern Andes and the Ucayali River, a region known as the Gran Pajonal due to its extensive tropical grasslands. Their cultural identity is deeply tied to their language, ancestral practices, and a profound connection to their territory, which they view as essential to their livelihood and cultural distinctiveness. This relationship fosters a strong ethic of environmental respect and sustainability, central to their organized community structure and long-standing desire for formal recognition separate from other Indigenous groups.
