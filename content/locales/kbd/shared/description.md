**Kabardian** (/kəˈbɑːrdiən/, also known as *East Circassian*) is a Northwest Caucasian language spoken by the eastern subgroups of Adygheans (Circassians). Identified by the ISO 639-3 code [kbd](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/kbd), it belongs to the **Northwest Caucasian language family** and is widely considered to be the eastern dialect of Adyghe. Kabardian is also one of the official languages of the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic and the Karachay-Cherkess Republic, both federal subjects of the Russian Federation.

The [Kabardian (East Circassians)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabardians) population is estimated at 500,000 to 750,000, yet only around 300,000 are believed to actively speak the language. Kabardians are primarily located in the **Kabardino-Balkaria** and **Karachay-Cherkessia** republics of **Russia**, with additional diaspora populations in **Turkey**, **Jordan**, **Syria**, and other countries due to historical migrations. The language includes several dialects, with the **Baksan** and **Malka** varieties being the most prominent. However, **only a limited portion of the Kabardian population is considered literate in the language**.

There is no definitive and official publication on this matter. Data published by organizations such as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabardians), Etnologue, and the Joshua Project do not reflect reality. Many Kabardians living in both the Caucasus and the Diaspora identify themselves as Adyghe unless specifically asked. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, researchers must be well-versed in the Adyghe tribes and their culture.
