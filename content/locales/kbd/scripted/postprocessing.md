These sentences are provided as-is, and no additional post-processing is required. However, users may choose to perform Unicode normalization (NFC or NFD) depending on their specific use case.

Although the sentences (questions/translation texts) have been written and verified using correct Unicode characters via the [**ady & kbd keyboard for Windows**](https://www.nemerko.org/adyghe-circassian-keyboard-for-windows-7-11/), it is possible that some text inputs beyond our control may have been submitted due to **Common Voice’s open participation model**.

After the datasets are published, we **re-audit** these entries and take the necessary steps to ensure **corrections in the next release**.
