Because there is no single agreed-upon font, we could not use texts copied from books. To compose sentences for the corpus, we developed a font that is as convenient as possible—simplified on the one hand, and refined with the addition of stressed vowels on the other. The material collected to date consists of short episodes written specifically for this corpus by several people. Editing was expressed in shortening sentences and reducing them to fewer than 15 words. Sometimes we had to check and clarify texts over the phone or in person. We also recorded the stories of those who knew the language best.
The biggest obstacle turned out to be:
    1. In Pirago, there is no single consonant () grapheme, for which we used the letter (ჰ̦), and the symbols for short vowels and consonants, placing them one by one on the graphemes, take a lot of time when typing;
    2. With two exceptions, elderly people cannot independently create voice recordings due to their lack of computer skills, even though they know the language well.
