# *Scots* &mdash; Scots (`sco`)
This datasheet is for version 1.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Spontaneous Speech* dataset 
for Scots (`sco`). The dataset contains 715 clips representing 12 hours of recorded
speech (11 hours validated) from 21 speakers.

## Language
Scots, a sister language of English spoken throughout Scotland, has a long history. It arose from northern English dialects around the 14th century and spread east and northwards, supplanting the indigenous Gaelic language, and developing into a socially and politically high status language with spoken and written norms distinct from those in England. From the 17th century onwards, political, religious and social events led to a loss of status, and thus a shrinking of the domains in which Scots was used, but while English norms replaced Scots in writing, *spoken* Scots continued to be used. Present day Scots is characterised by the *Scots Linguistic Continuum* with Standard Scottish English – generally described as being close to Standard English but with an overlay of distinctly Scottish sounds – at one end and Broad Scots – much further from Standard English with its own words, sounds and sentence structures – at the other. In terms of the social profiles, Scottish Standard English is spoken by middle class speakers and in more formal situations such as in schools, while Broad Scots is spoken by working class speakers and in informal situations such as with family and friends. Speakers may styleshift up and down the continuum according to, amongst others, interlocutor and context. At the Broad Scots end of the continuum, there is significant geographic diversity, where, for example, speakers in Glasgow sound very different to speakers in Aberdeen. The speakers in these recordings are from a range of geographic locations, and align more with the Broad Scots end of the continuum.

<!-- A description of the transcription system used -->

### Writing system
Present day Scots has no written standard and orthographic conventions vary both within and between the different dialects being represented. For example, *can’t* may be *cannae* or *canny* in Edinburgh, but *canna* in Aberdeen. For these transcriptions, we have followed protocols documented in previous research e.g. https://scotssyntaxatlas.ac.uk

#### Responses
There follows a randomly selected sample of transcribed responses from the corpus.
```
Some of the things that I like about where I live is that it’s a quiet area, eh, and you know the neighbours are pretty nosey, which is good, eh and they look after, eh, me and my daughter. Eh, I like that it’s away from the main road, I like that it’s quiet, eh, and I’ve always felt safe there. Eh, what I don’t like about it, eh, that’s really quite hard to answer, ‘cause I can’t think of anything. Eh, no can’t think of anything about- in general in Aberdeen I think eh, I like living here ‘cause it’s all I’ve known, eh, so I feel safe and, eh, secure here. What I don’t like about it is that it’s not very like nice to look at these days, there’s a lot of empty buildings, eh, and it doesn’t seem to be as, eh, productive of a place as I think it could be in terms of other cities like Glasgow and Edinburgh. Eh, so yeah, I feel like eh, Aberdeen can be a bit- I don’t know, unused I suppose to its full potential. 
I wish I had travelled more, and I wish I’d actually enjoyed school better, eh, to learn a lot more. However, when I was older I preferred- I went to college, but not as in for to do anything- it was more a course that was called ‘Fresh Start for Women’ and it gave you a wee taster of different things, you know, it gave you a taster of English, eh, it- maths, which I- as I said, I absolutely hated, eh, counselling, we were- I wanted to be a counsellor, so yeah, as in to help other people. However, when I was doing my training for that, my husband was getting paid off from his work, and I knew that I had to try and get a job for- to have money coming in, so I had to give up my college course, so yeah I think I wish that I’d actually stuck at that and become a counsellor. I know they say it’s never too late, but I think in time you know, you sort of lose the- the will to actual learn new things, eh so. So that’s no going to happen now, but yeah that’s a- I think that’s one of the things that I wish that I’d done was to stay on and study for- to be a counsellor.
Well, I dinna really want to describe a typical day in my job because I’m retired now and, eh, I just remember it as being- I liked my job and I like the folk I work with but life was just so hectic, ken?  Um, so I could do- well, I could do a typical day in, um, when I do invigilation at the school because I do that sometimes. So, I have to be there early, I have to be there before eight o’ clock. So when it’s the exams in May, that’s alright because it’s nice and bright and lightie in the morning, um, and you get there and then you access the papers at eight o’ clock because you cannae access them mair than an hour afore the exam starts which is normally nine o’ clock. Issue a’ the papers to the invigilators and then wait for them being returned and then package them a’ up and send them off to the SQA, so a lot of admin but fine ‘cause you’re no having to do any prep work at home, you’re no taking any work home with you. You just go in, do your job and then you leave and abody’s awfu' nice.
Oh favourite toy would’ve definitely, fann I was growing up, would’ve been Subbuteo, the football game. Eh, played a lot of that with my pals as young- we were kind of fairly compulsive obsessives as young loons and used to go roond to each other’s hooses and ended up having a, eh, a- like a little league, a little tournament among half a dozen of us. So undoubtedly- I think I’ve still got it in the hoose somewaie. Undoubtedly, it would be Subbuteo.
Well, if you’d asked me this ten year ago I’d have always said a big night oot on the toon or fittever, but nooadays ‘cause I’m getting older I think that’s less and less my idea of fun. Basically, my ideal party or celebration is something that doesnae involve wearing high heels, because they’re just miserable. Eh probably my ideal party would just be at somebody’s hoose nooadays. Somebody’s hoose, eh fine and comfy, you’ve got your own drink that doesnae cost a fortune, eh you dinna hae to deal with all they drunk folk coming up to you in the pub and speaking nonsense to you, eh you’re with your own pals. Eh yeah, that’s probably my ideal party. I’ve never really had a party party, ken like some folk for their eighteenth or their twenty-first or thirtieth or fittever, they have a big party in a function hall. I’ve never done that kind of partying ‘cause I’ve- I think I would aieways be feart that nobody would come, or I wouldnae hae enough pals or I wouldnae ken enough folk to hae a decent sized party, so I’ve never had that kind of party. But yeah, I probably prefer something low-key, with folk that I like, eh folk that I feel comfortable with, and eh yeah, we can just mak our own fun.
