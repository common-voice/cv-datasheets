In 2023, the [Academia Aragonesa de la Lengua](https://academiaaragonesadelalengua.org), a public institution created as language regulatory body, established the [Orthography of Aragonese](https://https://academiaaragonesadelalengua.org/sites/default/files/ficheros-pdf/ortografia-aragones.pdf) as the official spelling for the language. The spelling system is flexible enough to allow writing all Aragonese varieties.

All the submitted sentences have been adapted to the official orthography, although errors can be found occasionally.
