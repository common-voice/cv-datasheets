The dataset comprises a speech corpus totaling 15 hours, containing 2,077 Pahari sentences. The primary source for the corpus was the published books by Dr. Muhammad Saghir Khan, a distinguished literary figure and academician from Rawalakot, Poonch. This was supplemented with a smaller collection of sentences gathered from the daily conversations of native Pahari speakers. The entire set of written sentences was then recorded by 63 native speakers, all of whom are residents of the Poonch region of Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
