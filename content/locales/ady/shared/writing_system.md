The Adyghe language uses the **Cyrillic script** with some additional letters to represent specific sounds in the language. The [alphabet](https://www.omniglot.com/writing/adyghe.htm) consists of **66 letters**, including **33 standard** Cyrillic letters and **33 additional** letters unique to Adyghe. The writing system is phonetic, meaning that words are generally spelled as they are pronounced. Adyghe is written from left to right. 

During the period when there was no Adyghe keyboard option, the recorded text content was written with the Russian keyboard as the closest alternative. The characters in the Adyghe alphabet defined by the **Unicode Consortium** as **"Cyrillic Letter Palocka ('Ӏ': u04C0, utf-8)"** and **"Cyrillic Letter Small Palocka ('ӏ': u04CF, utf-8)"** are not defined in this keyboard model. For this reason, since the early days of computers, when creating digital data in Adyghe or Kabardian, one of the characters **"Latin Capital Letter i ('I': u0049, utf-8)"**, **"Latin Small Letter L ('l': u006C, utf-8)"** or **"Digit One ('1': u0031, utf-8)"**, albeit rarely **"Vertical Line ('|': u007C, utf-8)"** was used randomly due to their visual similarities ([Nemlioğlu, 2018](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385579626_BILISIM_ve_INTERNETTE_ADIGE_DILININ_KULLANIMININ_YAYGINLASMASININ_SAGLANMASI)). This situation emerges as an important factor that negatively affects data quality ([Nemlioğlu,2025](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395242067_ADYGABZEKE_KLAVIATURER_GEFEDENYM_ERYS_AKYLYM_ISKUSSTVENNYJ_INTELLEKT_IGESENYGE_MEHANEU_SYRIER)). 

Therefore we allowed the use of only the keyboard layout specially designed for Adyghe language in the Common Voice project. This keyboard layout includes all the letters of the Adyghe alphabet, including the special characters **"Cyrillic Letter Palocka ('Ӏ': u04C0, utf-8)"** and **"Cyrillic Letter Small Palocka ('ӏ': u04CF, utf-8)"**. The use of this keyboard layout has significantly improved the quality of the text data in Adyghe.
