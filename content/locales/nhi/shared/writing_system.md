Western Sierra Puebla Nahuatl is written in the Latin script. Specifically, the Common Voice corpus uses an orthographic 
norm defined by the Summer Institute of Linguistics in collaboration with the nhi-speaking community in San Miguel Tenango, 
Zacatlán, Puebla. See this [Description of the nhi alphabet](https://www.sil.org/system/files/reapdata/53/94/82/53948241349464823321651210693778285566/nhi_17154_El_alfabeto_del_nahuatl_de_los_municipios_07_002.pdf) for more information.

In most cases, Spanish loans, even those with Nahuatl morphology, are written in standard Spanish orthography (the Nahuatl morphemes follow the Nahuatl orthography described here, though it is worth noting the similarities between the writing systems so that there are only rare cases where the orthography change is noticeable).
