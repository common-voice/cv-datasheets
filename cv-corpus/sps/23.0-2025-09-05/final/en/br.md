# *Brezhoneg* &mdash; Breton (`br`)

 This datasheet is for version 23.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Spontaneous Speech* dataset 
for Breton (`br`). The dataset contains 28 clips representing 1 hours of recorded
speech (1 hours validated) from 5 speakers.

## Language
<!-- {{LANGUAGE_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- Provide a brief (1-2 paragraph) description of your language -->
Breton (Brezhoneg) is the only Celtic language spoken on the continent. It belongs to the Brittonic branch of the Celtic languages, like Welsh and Cornish. Breton is classified as "severely endangered" by the UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger. The language declined from more than one million speakers around 1950 to less than 200 000 in 2024. After a period of intense protest that began in the 1960s, Breton gradually regained a place in schools, on road signs, then in the media, public life in general, and more recently in digital technology. With the creation of the first bilingual schools at the end of the 1970s, young people were once again speaking Breton, and a change in the way people viewed the language and its use began. Approximately 20 000 pupils attend Breton bilingual classes, either in the Diwan network (immersive teaching) or in bilingual classes in public and catholic school systems. In addition to evening breton classes for adults (~4 000), long-term courses (6 to 9 months) are offered to adults, with approximately 350 places available annually and online courses too (more than 15 000 learners).

## Data splits for modelling

## Transcriptions
* Prompts: `22`
* Duration: `342828[ms]`
* Avg. Transcription Len: `92`
* Avg. Duration: `12.24[s]`
* Valid Duration: `35.03[s]`
* Total hours: `0.1[h]`

<!-- {{TRANSCRIPTIONS_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- A description of the transcription system used -->
The transcription system uses general Latin script, including some diacritics and considering ch and c'h like unique letters. c, q, x may appear in loanwords or foreign language words.

Hesitations in the answers are marked in square brackets (e.g. [euu])

### Writing system
<!-- {{WRITING_SYSTEM_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- @ OPTIONAL @ -->
<!-- A description of the writing system (or writing systems) used in the text corpus -->
The writing system in this dataset uses general Latin script. The diacritics à, è and é may appear in the transcription of Gwenedeg variant.

#### Symbol table
<!-- {{ALPHABET_TABLE}} -->
<!-- @ OPTIONAL @ -->
<!-- If the writing system is alphabetic, you can include the valid alphabet here -->
```a â b ch c'h d e ê f g h i j k l m n ñ o ô p r s t u ù û ü v w y z```

```à è é``` (for gwenedeg variant) 

```c q x``` (foreign, loanwords)

### Recommended post-processing
<!-- {{RECOMMENDED_POSTPROCESSING_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- @ OPTIONAL @ -->
<!-- What should people do before they use the data, for example Unicode normalisation or normalisation of extralinguistic tags -->
In Breton, c'h is considered to be a letter. To avoid confusion with the final apostrophe (U+2019 RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK), you can use the character U+02BC MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE for natural language processing purposes.

c'h : U+0063 LATIN SMALL LETTER C  U+02BC MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE  U+0068 LATIN SMALL LETTER H

### Fields
Each row of a `tsv` file represents a single audio clip, and contains the following information:

* `client_id` - hashed UUID of a given user
* `audio_id` - numeric id for audio file
* `audio_file` - audio file name
* `duration_ms` - duration of audio in milliseconds
* `prompt_id` - numeric id for prompt
* `prompt` - question for user
* `transcription` - transcription of the audio response
* `votes` - number of people that who approved a given transcript
* `age` - age of the speaker[^1]
* `gender` - gender of the speaker[^1]
* `language` - language name
* `split` - for data modelling, which subset of the data does this clip pertain to
* `char_per_sec` - how many characters of transcription per second of audio
* `quality_tags` - some automated assessment of the transcription--audio pair, separated by `|`
   *  `transcription-length` - character per second under 3 characters per second
   * `speech-rate` - characters per second over 30 characters per second
   * `short-audio` - audio length under 2 seconds
   * `long-audio` - audio length over 30 seconds
