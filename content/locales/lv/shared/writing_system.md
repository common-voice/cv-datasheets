Latvian alphabet is based on the Latin script and consists of 33 letters, including special characters with
diacritical marks such as ā, č, ē, ģ, ī, ķ, ļ, ņ, š, ū, and ž.

Historic texts also used letter /ŗ/, but use of it has been officially discontinued since 1946. 
This letter is equivalent to letter /r/ in modern Latvian orthography.

Letter /o/ can represent three different sounds [ua̯], [ɔ], [ɔː].

Letter /e/ can represent two different sounds [e], [æ].
