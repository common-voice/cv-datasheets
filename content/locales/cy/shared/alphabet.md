The 29 letters used for alphabetization in Welsh are:

```a b c ch d dd e f ff g ng h i j l ll m n o p ph r rh s t th u w y```

The letter j is borrowed from English to represent the borrowed /dʒ/ consonant phoneme. 

Welsh also uses diacritical marks on vowels (considered variants of their base letters, not separate letters for alphabetization):

With circumflex ('to bach'): ```â ê î ô û ŵ ŷ```

With acute accent: ```á é í ó ú ẃ ý```

With grave accent: ```à è ì ò ù ẁ ỳ```

With diaeresis: ```ä ë ï ö ü ẅ ÿ```

The traditional system lacks letters k, q, v, x, z, although these can appear in proper nouns and technical terms.
