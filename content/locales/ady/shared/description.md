**Adyghe** (/ˈædɪɡeɪ/ or /ˌɑːdɪˈɡeɪ/, also known as *West Circassian*) is a Northwest Caucasian language spoken by the western subgroups of Adygheans (Circassians). Identified by the ISO 639-3 code [ady](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/ady), it belongs to the **Northwest Caucasian language family**. Adyghe is also one of the official languages of the Republic of Adygea, a federal subject of the Russian Federation.

The [Adyghean (West Circassians)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassians) population is estimated to be between 1,200,000 to 2,000,000 although the number of active speakers is significantly lower. Adygheans are primarily located in the **Republic of Adygea**, **Russia**, with additional diaspora populations in **Turkey**, **Jordan**, **Israel**, **Syria**, the United States, **Canada**, and various **European countries** due to historical migrations. However, **only about 10% of the Adyghe population is considered literate in the language**.
