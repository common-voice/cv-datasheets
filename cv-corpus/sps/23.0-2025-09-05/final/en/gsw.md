# *Elsassisch* &mdash; Alsatian (`gsw`)
This datasheet is for version 23.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Spontaneous Speech* dataset 
for Alsatian (`gsw`). The dataset contains 3 clips representing 1 hours of recorded
speech (0 hours validated) from 1 speakers.

## Language
<!-- {{LANGUAGE_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- Provide a brief (1-2 paragraph) description of your language -->

Elsassisch (Alsatian in English, Alsacien in French) is a language spoken in the Alsace region in the East of France. As of 2022, 46 % of the population of the region declares speaking Alsatian. The term Alsatian refers to a linguistic continuum that includes varieties of Alemannic and Franconian. It shares the Alemannic language family with Swiss German and the Franconian language family with Luxembourgish.

 Note on the language code : There is currently no language code for specifically Alsatian. GSW is the code of Swiss German. However, the Common Voice community for Swiss German has chosen to be included under the umbrella of German, and thus isn't using the language code. It has been agreed to use GSW for Alsatian in the context of Common Voice. This does not mean that Alsatian is the same as Swiss German (even if some features are shared), and care should be taken to not mix up the two languages.

### Fields
Each row of a `tsv` file represents a single audio clip, and contains the following information:

* `client_id` - hashed UUID of a given user
* `audio_id` - numeric id for audio file
* `audio_file` - audio file name
* `duration_ms` - duration of audio in milliseconds
* `prompt_id` - numeric id for prompt
* `prompt` - question for user
* `transcription` - transcription of the audio response
* `votes` - number of people that who approved a given transcript
* `age` - age of the speaker[^1]
* `gender` - gender of the speaker[^1]
* `language` - language name
* `split` - for data modelling, which subset of the data does this clip pertain to
* `char_per_sec` - how many characters of transcription per second of audio
* `quality_tags` - some automated assessment of the transcription--audio pair, separated by `|`
   *  `transcription-length` - character per second under 3 characters per second
   * `speech-rate` - characters per second over 30 characters per second
   * `short-audio` - audio length under 2 seconds
   * `long-audio` - audio length over 30 seconds
