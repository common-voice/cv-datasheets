Both sources include sentences in both Norwegian Nynorsk and Norwegian Bokmål.

Norwegian Nynorsk candidate sentences were extracted by both excluding Bokmål-only words and including 
Nynorsk-only words:

| Only       | Words   |
|------------|------------|
| Bokmål |  *ikke*, *jeg*, *en*, *et*, *fra*, *hun*, *noen*, *være*, *mer*, *ble*, *mye*, *bare*, *boken*, *kommer*, *flere*, *dem*  |
| Nynorsk |  *eg*, *ikkje*, *ein*, *me*, *vere*, *meir*, *fleire*, *berre*, *ho*, *eit*, *blei*, *vart*  | 

These candidate sentences were then checked by two writers of Nynorsk to ensure that they were indeed written
in Nynorsk before inclusion into the corpus.
