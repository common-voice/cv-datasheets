Norwegian Nynorsk is a written standard of Norwegian. The standard is the preferred written 
standard of around 10-15% of the Norwegian population and is largely based on the Norwegian dialects
of the West of Norway.

The language code is `nn` and the locale is `nn-NO` (Nynorsk as written in Norway). Note that this 
locale includes the region code for historical reasons relating to the localisation platform. The dataset
contains Norwegian as spoken anywhere and as written in the Nynorsk standard.
