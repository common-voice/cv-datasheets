The Toba Qom language is an endangered language spoken in Gran Chaco, a region spanned over Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. As per the official demographic data provided by the Argentinian state, the population of Qom individuals is estimated at 80,000, of which approximately 49% are speakers of the oral form of the language. The term "qom" describes a population that has traditionally been arranged into multiple extended families or groups. Language and sociocultural traits that are essential to qom culture are shared by these groups, which are traditionally hunter-gatherer.
