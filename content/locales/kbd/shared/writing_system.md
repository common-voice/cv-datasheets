The Kabardian language uses the **Cyrillic script** with some additional letters to represent specific sounds in the language. The [alphabet](https://www.omniglot.com/writing/kabardian.htm) consists of **59 letters**, including **33 standard** Cyrillic letters and **26 additional** letters unique to Kabardian. The writing system is phonetic, meaning that words are generally spelled as they are pronounced. Kabardian is written from left to right.

During the period when there was no Kabardian keyboard option, the recorded text content was written with the Russian keyboard as the closest alternative. The characters in the Kabardian alphabet defined by the **Unicode Consortium** as **"Cyrillic Letter Palocka ('Ӏ': u04C0, utf-8)"** and **"Cyrillic Letter Small Palocka ('ӏ': u04CF, utf-8)"** are not defined in this keyboard model. For this reason, since the early days of computers, when creating digital data in Adyghe or Kabardian, one of the characters **"Latin Capital Letter i ('I': u0049, utf-8)"**, **"Latin Small Letter L ('l': u006C, utf-8)"** or **"Digit One ('1': u0031, utf-8)"**, albeit rarely **"Vertical Line ('|': u007C, utf-8)"** was used randomly due to their visual similarities ([Nemlioğlu, 2018](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385579626_BILISIM_ve_INTERNETTE_ADIGE_DILININ_KULLANIMININ_YAYGINLASMASININ_SAGLANMASI)). This situation emerges as an important factor that negatively affects data quality ([Nemlioğlu,2025](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395242067_ADYGABZEKE_KLAVIATURER_GEFEDENYM_ERYS_AKYLYM_ISKUSSTVENNYJ_INTELLEKT_IGESENYGE_MEHANEU_SYRIER)).
