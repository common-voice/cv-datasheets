# Example: Klingon (`tlh`)

This is a fictional reference example showing how to fill in datasheet
content for a locale. Use it as a guide when creating content for your
own locale.

- `shared/` files apply to both Scripted Speech (SCS) and Spontaneous
  Speech (SPS) datasets.
- `scripted/` and `spontaneous/` files apply only to their respective
  modality.
- You only need to create files you have content for. Empty files are
  ignored by the compile script.

See `content/_template/README.md` for the full list of possible files
and guidelines.
