# *Wakhi (Wuk̃hikwor)* &mdash; Wakhi (`wbl`)
This datasheet is for version 24.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Scripted Speech* dataset 
for Wakhi (`wbl`). The dataset contains 8192 clips representing 15.36 hours of recorded
speech (12.12 hours validated) from 14 speakers.

## Language
Wakhi or Wakhani is indigenously termed as K̃hikwor (contraction of Wuk̃hikwor). It's an old eastern Iranian or Iranic language within the Pamiri branch. Though, diasporas also live in Russia and Turkey as well as in the European, American an Australian continents, the Wakhi (or K̃hikwor) language is spoken indigenously in Pakistan, China, Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Kirghizistan.

<!-- ### Variants -->
<!-- {{VARIANT_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- @ OPTIONAL @ -->
<!-- Describe the variants (MCV variants) of your language -->
<!-- Original Answer: -->
<!-- The dataset has two key distinct varieties: Hunza Wakhi and out of Hunza Wakhi varieties. Hunza Wakhi differs not only in terms of its accent but somehow in grammatical features, too. Wakhi speakers of Ghizer and Chitral district have relatively similar accent. The grammatical aspects of these districts share a greater amount of Wakhi variety with the adjacent countries of their indigenous settlements. However, it's important to recognize that the huge vocabularies in all countries also differ to a significant level from each other, especially within technological realm in addition to following the respective national languages and some other genuine considerations. -->
