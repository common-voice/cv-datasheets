The writing system of Galician is based on the Latin alphabet, like other Romance languages (Spanish, Portuguese or French). Its orthography is regulated by the corresponding regional institutions that establish the official rules of use (NOMIG).

Galician uses the 23 letters of the basic Latin alphabet: 5 vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and 18 consonants. The vowel system of Galician is composed of seven oral vowels (/a/, /e/, /ɛ/, /i/, /o/, /ɔ/ and /u/), as the mid vowels ("e" and "o") have two possible pronunciations: open (/ɛ/, /ɔ/) and closed (/e/, /o/). At the consonant level, the letters Ç, J, K, W and Y are supported in foreign words, proper names, abbreviations and international acronyms. The Galician alphabet also has numerous digraphs: combinations of two letters that represent a single sound: "ch", "gu", "ll", "nh", "qu", "rr". In addition, the presence of the phoneme /ʃ/ represented by the letter “x”, the fricative sound /ʒ/, the distinction between /s/ and /θ/ which depends on the dialect areas, the gheada, etc., should be highlighted in the Galician consonant system.

Accentuation in Galician is quite regular and follows clear rules. A graphic "diacritical accent" is also used to distinguish pairs of words with the same spelling but different meanings, e.g., *bóla* (sphere, ball), *bola* (round type of bread).
